#	[] Why no_bid_action_id in bidding_rep ?
#		It allows the bidding always to start with North.
#		If North is not the dealer, then he must call 'no_bid'.
#		Until the dealer is reached, 'no_bid' must be the call.
#		I think this might help because it keeps a player's bid in a fixed 'column'.
#		Note: the 'no_bid' is only inserted in the bidding_rep, not in the actual game.
#
#	[] Why current_player_rep ?
#		Explanation here.
#
#	[] Note: hands_rep maintain the hands by N, E, S, W.
#
#	[] Note: trick_rep maintains the trick cards by N, E, S, W.
#	   The trick leader can be deduced since play is in clockwise direction.
#
#	[] Note: is_bidding_rep can be deduced from bidding_rep.
#	   I think I added is_bidding_rep before bidding_rep and thus it helped in early testing.
#	   My early testing had just the player's hand: I think the model conflated the bidding phase with the playing phase in this situation.
#	   Although is_bidding_rep is not needed, keeping it may improve learning.
#
#	[] Note: bidding_rep uses the action_id instead of one hot encoding.
#	   I think one hot encoding would make the input dimension significantly larger.

				1. The bidder's team tries to take at least as many tricks as they bid. 
				   If their bid is less than 13 and succeed, they score the number of tricks they won, and the other team scores nothing. 
			
				2. If the bidding team takes fewer tricks than they bid, they lose the amount of their bid, and the other team scores the number of tricks they won.

				3. Winning all 13 tricks is called kaboot. If the bid was less than 13, kaboot brings a bonus of 3 points, so 16 points in total instead of 13.

				4. If a team bids 13 tricks and wins them all, they score 26 points. 
				   If they lose any tricks, they score minus 16 and the other team scores double the number the tricks that they win.

				5. Further hands are played until one team achieves a cumulative score of 41 points (=terminal score) or more, and wins the game.
